# Vizora Test Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the specific steps required to fix the identified testing issues and make the Vizora test suite ready for CI/CD integration.

## Phase 1: Setup and Configuration Fix (Estimated: 2 days)

### VizoraMiddleware

1. **Resolve Jest Configuration Conflict**
   - Keep the configuration in package.json and permanently rename jest.config.js to jest.config.js.bak
   - Update the package.json configuration to include all necessary settings

2. **Create Mock Database Module**
   - Create a `tests/mocks/database.js` file that exports mock implementations of database functions
   - Update Jest configuration to properly mock this module

3. **Fix Setup File**
   - Implement the missing `connectDB` and `disconnectDB` functions in `tests/setup.js`
   - Ensure proper initialization and cleanup of test environment

### VizoraTV

1. **Fix TypeScript Setup**
   - Correct the syntax errors in setupTests.ts
   - Add esModuleInterop: true to tsconfig.json
   - Ensure JSX and React imports are properly configured

2. **Update Package Dependencies**
   - Ensure all test dependencies are installed and compatible

### VizoraWeb

1. **Fix React Router Mock**
   - Implement a proper mock for react-router-dom that exports all necessary components
   - Create a standardized mock pattern for external dependencies

2. **Resolve Mock Service Issues**
   - Ensure mock service implementations match the actual service interface
   - Fix contentService and other service mocks

## Phase 2: Test Isolation and Organization (Estimated: 3 days)

1. **Standardize Test Structure**
   - Implement a consistent test naming convention across all components
   - Organize tests into logical groups (unit, integration, e2e)

2. **Improve Test Isolation**
   - Review and fix tests that depend on each other
   - Ensure proper cleanup after each test
   - Implement better state isolation between tests

3. **Handle Asynchronous Operations**
   - Fix waitFor timeout issues in VizoraWeb tests
   - Implement consistent patterns for testing async operations
   - Add proper error handling in async tests

## Phase 3: Test Reliability Improvements (Estimated: 2 days)

1. **Address Flaky Tests**
   - Identify and fix tests that produce inconsistent results
   - Implement retries for network-dependent tests
   - Add deterministic behavior for time-dependent tests

2. **Performance Test Handling**
   - Add environment detection for performance tests
   - Make performance thresholds configurable
   - Create separate performance test suite that can be run independently

3. **Mock External Dependencies**
   - Ensure all external services are properly mocked
   - Implement consistent error simulation for external dependencies

## Phase 4: CI/CD Integration (Estimated: 2 days)

1. **Create CI Test Scripts**
   - Create a root-level script that runs all component tests
   - Add appropriate flags for CI environment (--ci, --runInBand, etc.)
   - Implement test result reporting in JUnit format

2. **Set Up Code Coverage**
   - Configure code coverage thresholds for each component
   - Create coverage reports that can be tracked over time
   - Set up coverage visualization in CI dashboard

3. **Implement Test Timeouts**
   - Add global timeout for the entire test suite
   - Configure per-test timeouts for long-running tests
   - Implement proper cleanup for tests that might hang

4. **Create Documentation**
   - Document the test approach and organization
   - Add instructions for running tests locally and in CI
   - Create troubleshooting guide for common test issues

## Implementation Priorities

1. **First Week**
   - Complete Phase 1 to make all tests at least capable of running
   - Begin Phase 2 work on test isolation

2. **Second Week**
   - Complete Phase 2 and Phase 3
   - Begin CI/CD integration

3. **Third Week**
   - Complete CI/CD integration
   - Run comprehensive tests and address any remaining issues
   - Finalize documentation

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All tests run without errors in a fresh environment
2. The test suite can be run reliably in a CI environment
3. Code coverage meets the defined thresholds (suggest min. 80%)
4. Tests complete in a reasonable time (under 5 minutes for the full suite)
5. Documentation is complete and up-to-date

## Resources Required

- 1 Senior Developer with testing expertise (full-time for 2 weeks)
- 1 Developer familiar with each component (part-time support)
- Access to CI/CD infrastructure for integration testing
- Local development environment that matches production

## Risk Mitigation

- Start with a small subset of tests to verify the approach before applying to all tests
- Maintain a backup of the original test files in case of issues
- Implement changes incrementally with regular validation
- Create a test branch that can be merged only when all tests pass reliably
