# VizoraTV Phase 1 Code Audit

| Feature                                | Status | Notes                                      |
|----------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------|
| PairingScreen & usePairing hook        | ✅     | Already implemented and tested; QR/code display, pairing, registration, error handling, and UI/UX are solid. |
| Registration confirmation persistence  | ✅     | Device context manages registration state and deviceId on load; no JWT/token persistence yet. |
| Content playback & scheduling          | ⚠️     | Delegated to VizoraDisplay; DisplayScreen renders VizoraDisplay, but scheduling/subscription logic is not directly wired in TV app. |
| Connection health indicator UI         | ❌     | No user-facing indicator; ConnectionManager handles retries and logs, but no visible status for end-users. |
| Crash recovery UI                      | ❌     | ErrorBoundary exists, but no dedicated crash recovery or user-facing fallback screen. |
| Heartbeat/status reporting             | ❌     | No periodic heartbeat/status events sent to middleware; feature not yet implemented. |
