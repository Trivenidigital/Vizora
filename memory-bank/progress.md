# Progress

## What Works
- Basic project architecture established across all applications
- ConnectionManager for standardized Socket.IO connections
- Shared TypeScript interfaces with Zod validation
- Admin dashboard foundation with TailwindCSS and Shadcn/UI
- TV display application with QR code generation
- Socket.IO diagnostic tools for connection testing
- Basic content upload and management functionality
- REST API endpoints for core operations
- Authentication system with JWT tokens

## What's Left to Build
- Complete QR-based pairing flow **(Auto-start on TV deferred)**
- Enhanced content scheduling interface
- Content playback with transitions
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Advanced monitoring dashboard
- Analytics and reporting features
- User management and role-based access control
- Multi-zone display layouts
- Integration with external content sources

## Current Status
- **VizoraWeb**: Basic admin interface functional, needs enhancement for content scheduling
- **VizoraTV**: Display and QR generation works, **requires manual "Start Pairing" button click for now (auto-start deferred)**, content playback needs completion
- **VizoraMiddleware**: Core API endpoints functional, socket handling in progress
- **VizoraDisplay**: Initial structure created, content orchestration in development
- **common**: ConnectionManager and shared types established, ongoing refinements

## Known Issues
- Socket reconnection handling needs improvement
- Authentication token refresh mechanism incomplete
- Content scheduling UI requires enhanced user experience
- Error handling for network failures needs standardization
- Performance optimization for content delivery not implemented
- **VizoraTV pairing doesn't reliably auto-start on load (requires button click); issue deferred.**

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Socket Communication
- **Initial Approach**: Multiple Socket.IO namespaces for different functions
- **Current Approach**: Single root namespace with event-based routing
- **Reasoning**: Simplifies connection management and authentication

### State Management
- **Initial Approach**: Redux for global state
- **Current Approach**: React Query + context for most state needs
- **Reasoning**: Reduced boilerplate and better alignment with API-centric architecture

### Content Storage
- **Initial Approach**: All content in MongoDB
- **Current Approach**: Metadata in MongoDB, files in filesystem (future cloud storage)
- **Reasoning**: Better performance and scalability

### UI Framework
- **Initial Approach**: Material UI components
- **Current Approach**: TailwindCSS + Shadcn/UI
- **Reasoning**: More flexibility, better customization, reduced bundle size

### API Structure
- **Initial Approach**: GraphQL API
- **Current Approach**: RESTful API endpoints
- **Reasoning**: Simpler implementation, better alignment with existing skills

## Upcoming Milestones
1. **Complete Device Pairing**: Finalize the QR-based pairing system
2. **Content Scheduling**: Implement the scheduling interface and engine
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Build comprehensive display monitoring
4. **Content Playback**: Complete the content rendering and transition system
5. **User Management**: Implement role-based access control

## Implementation Priorities
1. Critical socket connection reliability
2. QR pairing flow completion
3. Content scheduling interface
4. Error handling and recovery
5. Display status monitoring dashboard
