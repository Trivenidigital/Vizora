## ⚠️ Critical Decision

**DO NOT add new features until Phase 1 is complete.**

**Why?**
- Users will judge quality on what exists, not roadmap
- Polish compounds (better UX → better retention → better feedback)
- Rough UI + more features = more surface area to fix later
- 4 weeks of polish > 4 weeks of half-baked features

**The Rule:**
> "Make what exists great before making more things that are just okay."
