Subject: Cut Your Printing Costs by 90% with Digital Signage

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] has [X] locations. Are you still printing menus/posters for each one?

Most of our customers were spending $15K+/year on printing and shipping. They cut that to almost zero with Vizora.

**What is Vizora?**
Cloud-based digital signage that lets you update all locations instantly from your desk. No more printing, shipping, or installation.

**Results:**
• Save 90% on printing costs
• Update all displays in minutes (not days)
• Increase sales 30% with dynamic content

Want to see a quick demo? Takes 15 minutes.

Best,
[Your Name]
