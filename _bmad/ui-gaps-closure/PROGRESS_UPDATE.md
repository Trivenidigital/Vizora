|-----|----------|--------|------|---------|
| #1: Search Bars | P0 | ✅ Complete | 3 min | Already implemented (3/3 pages) |
| #2: Edit Content | P0 | ✅ Complete | 2 min | Fully functional with validation |

## Analysis

**Pattern Detected:** Many P0 gaps appear to have been implemented already but not documented in gap analysis.

**Hypothesis:** Gap analysis document (`UI_GAP_ANALYSIS_IMPLEMENTED_FEATURES.md`) was created BEFORE recent development work.

**Action:** Continue inventory of remaining P0 gaps to identify **truly missing** features.

## Next Up

Checking **Gap #4: Pagination for Tables** (devices page)

Expected: Likely also complete based on pattern

**Efficiency:** Discovery phase = 2-3 min per gap  
**Cost:** Minimal (Haiku model, read-only operations)  
**Value:** Accurate assessment of actual work needed
