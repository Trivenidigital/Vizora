# Vizora Middleware API Fixes

This document outlines the API issues that were fixed and how to implement the fixes.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Invalid JSON Responses
- The original servers were sometimes returning HTML instead of JSON for API endpoints
- Some endpoints had inconsistent response formats
- The `/api/folders` endpoint was returning a 404 error with HTML

### 2. CORS Configuration Issues
- Missing or incomplete CORS configuration
- Credentials not properly supported
- Inconsistent CORS headers across different endpoints
- Improper handling of preflight OPTIONS requests

### 3. API Routing Problems
- The 404 handler was catching valid routes
- Route ordering issues causing valid endpoints to be missed
- Inconsistent route naming and handling

### 4. Frontend Integration Problems
- apiClient configuration needed updating to support credentials
- Authentication endpoints path inconsistencies
- Error handling in contentService.ts needed improvement

## Solution Implemented

We created a `unified-server.js` that addresses all these issues:

### 1. Comprehensive CORS Support
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: ['http://localhost:5173', 'http://127.0.0.1:5173'],
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With'],
  exposedHeaders: ['Set-Cookie'],
  credentials: true,
  maxAge: 86400 // 24 hours
}));
```

### 2. Consistent API Response Format
All API endpoints now follow the same response format:
```javascript
res.json({
  success: true,
  data: responseData
});
```

Or for errors:
```javascript
res.status(errorCode).json({
  success: false,
  message: 'Descriptive error message'
});
```

### 3. Proper Route Ordering
- Route handlers are defined before any catch-all or 404 handlers
- Multiple route patterns support the same functionality (e.g., both `/api/folders` and `/folders`)
- Explicit preflight handling for CORS

### 4. Improved Authentication
- Proper JWT token handling
- Cookie-based authentication with appropriate settings
- Comprehensive error messages for auth failures

### 5. Detailed Logging
- All requests are logged with timestamp, method, and URL
- Request bodies are logged for debugging
- Response statuses are tracked

## How to Use

1. **Stop any existing servers** that might be running
2. **Run the unified server:**
   ```
   cd Redesign/VizoraMiddleware
   node unified-server.js
   ```
3. **Test the API** using the built-in test page:
   - Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser
   - The test page lets you try all authentication endpoints

## Frontend Compatibility

The frontend should work with these changes since we:

1. Updated the authService.ts to use `/api/auth/*` endpoints
2. Fixed the apiClient.ts configuration to support credentials
3. Ensured consistent response formats that match what the frontend expects

## Test Procedures

To verify the fixes are working:

1. **Authentication Test**:
   - Use the test page to try logging in
   - Verify that you get a valid token back

2. **API Endpoint Test**:
   - Access http://localhost:3000/api/folders in your browser
   - Verify you get a proper JSON response with folder data

3. **Frontend Integration Test**:
   - Run the frontend application
   - Attempt to log in
   - Navigate to dashboard and verify folders load correctly
   - Check that content loads properly within folders

## Future Improvements

1. **Add database integration** to replace mock data
2. **Implement proper token validation** for secured endpoints
3. **Add proper error handling** for database connection issues
4. **Create comprehensive logging** for production deployment
