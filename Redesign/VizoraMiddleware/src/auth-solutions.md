# Authentication Solutions for Vizora Middleware

## Issues Identified

1. The main server.js was having issues with circular dependencies, particularly related to auth routes.
2. The frontend was unable to connect to the auth endpoints, receiving 404 errors.
3. The User model and authentication logic itself works correctly as confirmed by direct testing.

## Working Authentication Flow

We've confirmed that the authentication flow works correctly with our test user:

- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `password123`

The authentication process works correctly:

1. The password comparison in the User model works
2. Token generation works
3. Token verification works

## Solution Implementation

We've implemented two key solutions:

1. **Direct Authentication Script**: We created a script (`direct-login-test.js`) that connects directly to MongoDB, finds a user, verifies credentials, and generates a token. This bypasses Express routing issues and confirms the core auth logic works.

2. **Simplified Test Server**: We created a simple Express server (`server-test.js`) that implements the authentication flow correctly, confirming our authentication middleware approach is sound.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Circular Dependencies**: Review the main server.js file to remove any circular dependencies, particularly around app.use('/api', app) which would create an infinite loop.

2. **Use Direct Auth Routes**: Consider using the direct auth approach we've implemented in `direct-auth.js`, which is already properly imported in app.js.

3. **Test With Known Credentials**: Use the test user we've created to test authentication in the main application.

4. **Add Better Error Handling**: Add more detailed error logging to help diagnose authentication issues in the future.

## Test Scripts

We've created several test scripts to help diagnose and fix authentication issues:

- `src/test-user.js`: Tests finding users and password matching
- `src/create-test-user.js`: Creates a test user with known credentials
- `src/direct-login-test.js`: Tests authentication directly with the User model
- `server-test.js`: A simplified server that implements the authentication flow

## Token Usage

Once you have a token, you can use it in your API requests like this:

```powershell
$token = "your.jwt.token"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $token" }
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3003/api/protected-route" -Headers $headers
```

Or in JavaScript:

```javascript
const token = "your.jwt.token";
fetch("http://localhost:3003/api/protected-route", {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```
