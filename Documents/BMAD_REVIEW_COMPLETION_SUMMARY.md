## 🔄 How I Will Use BMAD for Vizora Development

### 5 Core Principles

1. **Think First, Code Second**
   - Every task starts with analysis
   - Design before implementation
   - Verification before merge

2. **Specialized Agents, Single Thinker**
   - I have agent capabilities for different aspects
   - But you make the decisions
   - Clear guidance, not dictation

3. **Verification at Each Step**
   - `/quick-spec` → validate understanding
   - `/bmad-dev-story` → validate code
   - `/bmad-code-review` → validate quality

4. **Documented Decisions**
   - Every commit explains "why"
   - All decisions traceable
   - Knowledge base continuously built

5. **Scale-Appropriate Process**
   - Bug fixes: Fast workflow
   - Features: Standard workflow
   - System changes: Full workflow

### Workflow Application for Vizora

```
For Bug Fixes (Today's 3 Blockers):
/quick-spec → /bmad-dev-story → /bmad-code-review
(30 min each)

For New Features (This Week):
/bmad-create-product-brief → /bmad-create-architecture
→ /bmad-create-epics-and-stories → /bmad-dev-story
(2-4 hours)

For System Changes (Next Month):
Full architecture review → Planning → Implementation
→ Integration testing → Documentation
(3-5 days)
```
