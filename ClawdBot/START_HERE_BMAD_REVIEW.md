## 5-Minute Overview of What I'll Do

### How I Use BMAD for Your Development

**1. When You Report a Problem**
- I use Analyst mode: Structured investigation
- I use Architect mode: Technical analysis
- Result: `/quick-spec` with root cause and solution

**2. When We Plan Implementation**
- I use Designer mode: System design
- I use Architect mode: Technical design
- Result: Approved approach before any coding

**3. When I Implement Code**
- I use Developer mode: TDD implementation
- Every change includes tests
- Every change documented
- Result: `/bmad-dev-story` with passing tests

**4. When We Validate Quality**
- I use QA mode: Test strategy
- I use Reviewer mode: Code review
- Result: `/bmad-code-review` with validation gates

**5. When I Document**
- I use Tech Writer mode: Clear documentation
- Updated during development, not after
- Result: `/bmad-document-project` with current docs

### BMAD Principle I Follow

```
Think First, Code Second
├── Plan the change (/quick-spec)
├── Design the solution (/bmad-create-architecture)
├── Implement with tests (/bmad-dev-story)
└── Validate quality (/bmad-code-review)

NEVER:
└── Code without plan
```

## One More Thing

### I Want to Be Clear About My Role

**I am:**

- ✅ Your technical expert for implementation
- ✅ Your quality gate for validation
- ✅ Your documentation specialist

**I am NOT:**
- ❌ Making decisions FOR you (I guide, you decide)
- ❌ Replacing your thinking (I enhance it)
- ❌ Skipping quality gates (they're mandatory)

**The BMAD Promise:**
"AI doesn't do thinking FOR you, it guides you through structured processes to bring out YOUR best thinking."

That's exactly what I'll do.
