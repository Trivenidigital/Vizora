# Cache Functionality Fixes

## Missing Functions Added:

1. Added missing cache-related functions to contentService.ts:
   - getCacheStatus
   - getLastSync
   - setCachingEnabled
   - clearCache

2. Added proper CacheStatusType import from storage

3. Added the new methods to the contentService export object

## State Variables Added in ContentLibrary.tsx:

1. Added showCacheInfo state variable
2. Added toggleCacheInfo function to control the cache info panel visibility

All these changes ensure the cache information panel works correctly and allows users to view and manage the content cache.
