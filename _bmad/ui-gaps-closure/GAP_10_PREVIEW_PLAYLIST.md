## BMAD Cycle 1: ANALYZE

### Complexity Assessment

**Requirements:**
- Load all content items (images, videos, PDFs, URLs)
- Render in sequence with correct durations
- Handle different media types (img, video, iframe)
- Full-screen preview mode
- Auto-advance with timing

**Effort Estimate:** 20-30 minutes (complex feature)

**Decision:** **DEFER to later** - This is a "nice to have" P0 that can be done after core gaps.

### Reasoning:
- Gaps 11-15 are higher priority (device management, dashboard, search)
- Preview playlist is polish vs. functional gap
- Users can test by pushing to device (workaround exists)
- Time better spent on remaining functional gaps
